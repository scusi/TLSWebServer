#
# HttpAddr is the address for the http redirector to listen to.
# HttpAddr has the format "IP:PORT" or "HOSTNAME:PORT".
# It is valid to have just write ":PORT". 
# In this case http redirector listens on all available interfaces.
# If HttpAddr is empty no http redirector will be started.
# All requests that are made to this Address will be redirected to the HttpsAddress.
HttpAddr: :8080

# ExposedHttpAddr should be set if the exposed https port is different from the HttpAddr (set above)
# It is used for http redirects, to redirect the client to the right (exposed) http port.
ExposedHttpsAddr: :80

# HttpsAddr is the address the tls web server listens to.
# Format is the same as with HttpAddr 
HttpsAddr: :8443

# ExposedHttpsAddr should be set if the exposed https port is different from the HttpsAddr (set above)
# It is used for http redirects, to redirect the client to the right (exposed) https port.
ExposedHttpsAddr: :443
